# CrossConnect Bible #
It's been a very busy month for CrossConnect Bible. We have had a few new people express interest in helping contribute to the project. To you guys, a great welcome and thank you for your interest in our desire to spread God's word. As such it is thus extremely important that the objectives and philosophy of CrossConnect Bible is clearly shown, so that you contributors are fully aware of what we stand for and if you wish to continue in our ministries.

## Objective - a means for the Gospel ##

_For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you, because our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction. You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake.
(1 Thessalonians 1:4-5 ESV)_

CrossConnect Bible aims to be a means by which God's word can be heard and understood, and so, God willing, many will be convicted of the truth and through the power of the Holy Spirit be transformed and live changed lives until he returns.

## Philosophy - Free, Open Source and Relevant ##

**Free** - The app will always be free of charge, the word belongs to God and is written for all to hear. All donations received for CrossConnect Bible 3 will be used to fund further developments of the project.

**Open Source** - One of the biggest problems with spreading the word through software and digitally is Copyright and Intellectual Property. Many of the most popular translations are copyrighted as well as resource content. We beleive this inhibits spiritual growth. Although we cannot change the copyright stances, by making a Android Bible reader Open Source and community based, we aim to set a precedence and encourage everyone and anyone whom agrees with the spreading of the word to contribute to this online ministry. (A big shoutout to the Sword community, DesiringGod and Crossways ESV for all their hard work at making resources so available and not for their own gain!). We beleive that Christians brothers and sisters should be given the freedom to express and build on tools which will further his Kingdom rather than have to rely on corporations and companies.

**Relevant** - There has never been a time where the Bible has been more freely available. Yet in many modern countries, there is never been a greater struggle in seeing the relevance of the word. CrossConnect Bible aims to provide the tools and means by which people are aided in truly comprehending the doctrinal truths in a way which works well in the way we live today. E.g. Being able to listen to the Bible in audio form, have resources and commentaries readily available.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments or questions whatsoever. Again thank you for taking your time in reading this! May God bless you in your love and knowledge of our great creator and saviour.
